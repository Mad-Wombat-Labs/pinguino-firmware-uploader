#+title: Manual Upload Script for Pinguino boards

* Description

This repositories contains a minimal pinguino upload script for those
who at one time used the [[http://pinguino.cc][Pinguino]] ide and now just want to upload code
to PICs flashed with the pinguino bootloader, without needing to load
the whole hog.

It started life as a script I found in the pinguino sources itself,
but which since seems to have been deleted.  It underwent minor
modifications to work with python3, whose usb support is clearly
slightly different from that which was in place back when it was first
written.

I have used it with Pic18F2550/4550 devices.  With anything else it is
untested.
